### Introduction

This repository provide Python/Ipython code to solve the Kaggle Titanic Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) using machine learning.

The Kaggle Titanic Challenge is a good practice for those who just enter the data science field and are trying to work on their first machine learning project. 

Here I provided a clear machine learning pipeline and thorough explanations of all the code, with the aim of helping newbies grasp the essence of machine learning quickly. The first version of code (ML_Titanic.py) is written in Python and the second version of code(Titanic_Oct2017.ipynb) is written in Jupyter notebook.

Please refer to the following link for more detailed description of the machine learning pipeline: zhaoxiablog.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/machine-learning-pipeline-using-python/
